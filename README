rtone-br2-external is a Buildroot br2-external tree to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

0) run 'git clone https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot'
1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!
